# Toliver's Profile Generator

## Description

This project is a Node.js command-line application that generates a simple HTML page displaying a software team's members. The user is prompted with questions about their team members, and they can choose from three categories: Manager, Engineer, and Intern. In this project, I am utilizing what I have learned about Node and Javascript Object-oriented programming.

## Tests

In order to test the app.js file, I have created a test file called app.test.js . which  tests whether the objects employed in the original app.js file (employee, manager, engineer, and intern) are successfully generating team members. Simply run "npm test" in the command-line to test the program.
